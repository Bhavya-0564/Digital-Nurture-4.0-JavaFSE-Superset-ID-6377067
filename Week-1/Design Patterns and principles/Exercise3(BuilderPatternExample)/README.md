# Builder Pattern Example

This project demonstrates the **Builder Pattern**, a creational design pattern that allows for the step-by-step construction of a complex object.

## Project Structure

- `Computer.java`: Defines the `Computer` class and its nested `Builder` class for constructing `Computer` objects.
- `BuilderPatternTest.java`: Contains the `main` method to showcase the usage of the Builder Pattern to create different `Computer` configurations.

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac Computer.java BuilderPatternTest.java
   ```
2. Run the test class:
   ```bash
   java BuilderPatternTest
   ```
