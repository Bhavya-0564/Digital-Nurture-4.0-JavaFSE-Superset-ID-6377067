This project demonstrates the **Factory Method Pattern**, a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Project Structure

This example includes various document types and their corresponding factories:

- `Document.java`: Interface for documents.
- `ExcelDocument.java`: Implementation for Excel documents.
- `PdfDocument.java`: Implementation for PDF documents.
- `WordDocument.java`: Implementation for Word documents.

- `DocumentFactory.java`: Abstract factory for creating documents.
- `ExcelDocumentFactory.java`: Concrete factory for creating Excel documents.
- `PdfDocumentFactory.java`: Concrete factory for creating PDF documents.
- `WordDocumentFactory.java`: Concrete factory for creating Word documents.

- `FactoryMethodTest.java`: Main class to demonstrate the usage of the factory method pattern.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile the Java files, navigate to the `Exercise2(FactoryMethodPatternExample)` directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
javac *.java
```

To run the main test class:

```bash
java FactoryMethodTest
