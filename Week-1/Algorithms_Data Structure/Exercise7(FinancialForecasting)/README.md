## Scenario

This project involves developing a financial forecasting tool designed to predict future values by leveraging historical data.

## 1. Understanding Recursive Algorithms

Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It simplifies complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, identical sub-problems. A recursive solution typically involves a base case, which defines the condition under which the function stops calling itself, and a recursive step, where the function calls itself with modified inputs, moving closer to the base case. In financial forecasting, recursion can be applied to models where each future value depends on the previous one, naturally fitting a recursive definition.

## 2. Setup

The core of this forecasting tool involves a method designed to calculate future financial values. This method utilizes a recursive approach, meaning that the calculation for a given period relies on the calculated value of the preceding period. This structure allows for a clear and concise definition of how values propagate over time based on historical growth patterns.

## 3. Implementation

The forecasting algorithm predicts future values by applying a historical growth rate iteratively. The recursive implementation works as follows: to predict the value for a future period, the function calculates the value based on the previous period's forecasted value and the given growth rate. The base case for the recursion is the initial present value, from which all future values are derived.

## 4. Analysis

### Time Complexity

The recursive algorithm, as implemented for financial forecasting, has a time complexity of O(n), where 'n' is the number of periods into the future for which the forecast is made. This is because each recursive call processes one period, and there are 'n' such calls until the base case (the present value) is reached.

### Optimization

<<<<<<< HEAD
While the recursive approach is intuitive, a naive implementation can lead to excessive computation, especially if the same sub-problems are calculated multiple times (though not typically an issue in a simple linear recurrence like this). To optimize recursive solutions and avoid redundant computations, especially in more complex recursive scenarios, memoization or dynamic programming can be employed. Memoization involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. For linear recurrences like this financial forecast, an iterative solution often provides better performance and avoids the overhead of recursive function calls, effectively transforming the recursion into a simple loop.
