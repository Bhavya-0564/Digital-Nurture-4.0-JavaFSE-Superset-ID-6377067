# Inventory Management System

## 1. Problem Understanding

### Why Data Structures and Algorithms are Essential:

For an inventory management system, efficient handling of large inventories is crucial. Data structures and algorithms ensure efficient storage, retrieval, scalability, data integrity, and optimized operations for product information.

### Suitable Data Structures:

`HashMap` is generally the most suitable choice for this system due to its average O(1) time complexity for `add`, `update`, and `delete` operations, using `productId` as the unique key. Other options like `ArrayList` or `TreeMap` have different performance characteristics (O(n) and O(log n) respectively for typical operations).

## 2. Setup

To set up this project, ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can then compile and run the `InventoryManagementSystem.java` file.

## 3. Implementation

### `Product` Class Definition:

The `Product` class defines attributes such as `productId`, `productName`, `quantity`, and `price` along with their respective getters and setters.

### Chosen Data Structure: `HashMap`

The system uses a `HashMap<String, Product>` to store products, where the `productId` serves as the key for quick access.

### Inventory Management Methods:

Methods are implemented to perform core inventory operations: `addProduct` (adds a new product), `updateProduct` (modifies an existing product's quantity and/or price), and `deleteProduct` (removes a product).

## 4. Analysis

### Time Complexity of Operations (using `HashMap`):

*   **`addProduct` (Add):** O(1) on average.
*   **`updateProduct` (Update):** O(1) on average.
*   **`deleteProduct` (Delete):** O(1) on average.

### Optimization:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Optimizations include choosing the right data structure (`HashMap` for O(1) average time complexity), ensuring a good hashing function, and potentially fine-tuning `HashMap` capacity for very large inventories. For advanced scenarios, batch operations, indexing for other attributes, and database integration can further enhance performance and scalability.
